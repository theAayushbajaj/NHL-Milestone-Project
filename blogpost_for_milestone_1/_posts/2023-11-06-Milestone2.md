#  Baseline Model 

## Question 1 
The accuracy for the baseline model `LogisticClassifier` using only `shot_distance` is `95.51%`. However, further analysis as shown in `classification_report` reveals that the model is prediction `not_goal` label for every shot given as input. This is also apparent in the `percision` and `recall` for `is_goal` label which is zero. 

Looking more deeply at the dataset shows that this data is higly unbalanced. See the following picture.
